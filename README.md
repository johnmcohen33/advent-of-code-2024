# Advent of Code 2024

Contained in this repository are my attempts to practice Python and Typescript. Even with four years of experience as an engineer, I found it too easy to take shortcuts and acquired too many bad habits. This repo will be a sandbox to write better code, practice design patterns, improve my testing, and anything else I discover on the way. This aims to be fun and hone my skills as a language developer. If you have any feedback on improving my code, let me know!
